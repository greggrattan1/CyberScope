	Guidance:
	


	Initial Maturity: Intermittent operational use, alerts are triaged manually, as well as on an ad-hoc basis.
	

	Advanced Maturity: Moderate level of expertise depending on SOC. Tool tuning, scheduled sweeps, and conducting threat hunting activities. Some automation employed to triage events and alerts. False positives are significantly reduced.
	

	Optimal Maturity: Highly tuned and integrated into daily SOC operations (security event/incident investigations) with well-practiced incident response playbooks (automated if possible), and comprehensive reporting. False positives are exceptionally rare and automation is heavily employed to minimize human interactions with the EDR solution to triage common alerts. Dynamic policies are employed to allow the EDR solution to go beyond static identification and detection of anomalous activity.
